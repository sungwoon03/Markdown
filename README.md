### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.  
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.  

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection:](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)
